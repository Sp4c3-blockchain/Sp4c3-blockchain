SP4C3 â€“ A Distributed storage, AI cloud computing system based on the Ethereum network. The platform seeks to expand the Ethereum ecosystem and support financial and non-financial applications, using technology to connect the digital and physical worlds. SP4C3 delivers real value for diverse industries and people. 

As a new data storage and distribution network, SP4C3 seeks to build a distributed and efficient network based on the Ethereum network. Powerful data storage centers mainly serve as the primary data storage depot for financial institutions and banking systems. 

Simultaneously, based on the distributed core of the banking financial business, a highly scalable financial cloud and AI computing system arises. This process completes the open-source AI cloud computing platform to support the innovation of the digital financial system.  

SP4C3 will also play an important role in non-financial applications. Through efficient AI computing systems, video analysis, structured AI in combination with different algorithms, of AI workforce to support the application of cloud, including AI intelligent management, automatic face recognition, and intelligent search and intelligent identification, such as disaster control, to help the landing of non-financial applications. 

SP4C3 will achieve this mission by stimulating the continuous growth of its economy, continuously supporting and cooperating with third-party projects to achieve application landing and combining technology research and iteration of hardware. 

SP4C3 will combine the distributed storage system with AI cloud computing to build a safe and efficient new generation of distributed architecture that aggregates computing power and connects the financial and non-financial systems
